INFORMATION:
	People: ABCDE 
	Groups: AGLO, SAT

For convenience, you are allowed to use forall and exist with the following syntax: forall i,j in A,B
Specify:

• What propositions (variables) you use to model the problem.
	SAT_X: Person X is in group SAT 
	ALGO_X: Person X is in group AGLO 
	with SAT_X not equal to ALGO_X - either a person is in one group or not!

1) SAT_A AND SAT_C 
2) (NOT SAT_D) AND (SAT_E)
3) forall i,j in people_i groups_j(sum(groups_j_i)>2) (e.g. sum(ALGO_A + ALGO_B + ...))
4) ALGO_B
5) SAT_E
• What the formula is.
(SAT_A AND SAT_C) 
AND 
(NOT SAT_D) AND (SAT_E)
AND 
forall i,j in people_i groups_j(sum(groups_j_i)>2) (e.g. sum(ALGO_A + ALGO_B + ...))
AND 
ALGO_B
AND 
SAT_E

• How to find out how to form the groups given an assignment.
Step 1: Pass formula to SAT-solver and observe result of variable assignment
Step 2: If ALGO_X = 1, place student X in ALGO group - similarly for SAT_X. 

• How to expand solution to other students
Simply add two new boolean vars for each student ALGO_X, SAT_X - constraints approrpriate to each student can be formed with this
